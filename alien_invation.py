'''
The main file of the program. It creates a number of important objects used throughout the game. The settings are stored in ai_settings, the main display surface is stored in screen, and a ship
instance is created in this file as well. Also stored in this file is the main loop of the game, which is a while loop that calls check_events, ship_update, and update_screen. This is the only file
you need to run for the game. All the other files are imported into this one
